**Openzip** is a Ruby library (written in Rust) for fast extract Zip files.

## Usage

Before you begin, you need to install both Rust and Cargo on your system ([https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org)).

```ruby
path_to_zip = "path/to/zipfile.zip"
extract_to_path = "path/to/extract"

Openzip.extract(path_to_zip, extract_to_path) # returns true if method was executed successfully
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'openzip'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install openzip
